# traffic_lights
A C++ library to make a traffic light work


There three codes in here two of them use a non blocking techniques and one of them is brute force, the traffic_light is the only one that is presented as a library ready to use that has been verified in proteus.

The nonblocking and the library are both codes created to simulate faster and se the functioning faster, so the times dont ocrrespond to real time but with the comments you can change what the time should be
